b. Describe at lest 3 possible faults:
1.  The index could be incorrect and start at the the index 1 when doing the search instead of starting at index 0
2.  The index that is used in line 99 "secondList.get(i-1)" could be "secondList.get(i)" returning the incorrect value
3.  If the code should check for duplicate values 
4.  Should the code consider lower and upper case the same  
5.  The requirements do not state if it has to be a string or int value

c.  Describe your rationale for each test: 
I generated my test using the test case generator.  Then I modified them to test the results based on the index of
the of the result ArrayList.  I also check to see if it matter if the list were lower and upper case.  
I also checked if it matter if one list contained duplicates and if both list contained duplicates

c. Describe the result foe each test set:
I found that my code was incorrect and had to change the index for the loop.  I forgot that the index 
increase before evaluating contains statement causing the first result to be missing.  I found that
lower and upper case do matter.  I found duplicates were counted.



d. Describe the new results of each test set:



e.
